    <h2> <strong> The progress of soccer </strong> </h2> 
    <p>Soccer progressed until what we see now which is a perfect fine sport which many people play. Soccer started of in ancient china about 2000 years ago. 
        But many other countres like Greece and Rome also claimed that the sport was for them. But it was England that transitioned soccer. At the beginning of
        soccer they played with small leather balls which could pop or get desroyed really easily but then they started developing the ball into what we see now:  </p>

        <il> <strong> Hands: </strong> <br>           
                 This rule only goes to the players that are not in goal because they are not allowed to hold the ball in there hands or it will be cheating and the other team 
               will get a freekick, or a penalty if they touched it inside the box. <br>
               
                                                  <il>   <strong>  Corner Kicks & Goal Kicks </strong> <br>
                                                      Corner kicks and goal kicks only happen when the other team shoots the ball out of the goal line. if the opposing team 
                                                      shoots the ball there it is a goal kick, if the other team shoots there it is a corner kick. <br>
                                                      <il> <strong>   Fouls  </strong> <br>

                                                                 either get a red card, a yellow card or a warning. <br>

                                                                 <il>  <strong> Penalty Kicks </strong>  <br>

                                                                     on the white dot inide the box andhe will shoot. <br>
